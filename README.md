# Machine Learning Models For Supervised Learning 

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

*  In this repo I did create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.
* Use GridSearch to tune model parameters.

I used many models to choice the best Accuracy model based on train and test split data.

---
Models that used:
* KNeighbors Classifier.
* Support Vector Machine.
* Random Foarest.
* Logistic Regression.
* Sequential.




they didn't genrilizes well on unseen data 

knn : this model generalized well on unseen data but based on the classification report and  the accuracy of the model is low in compare with the other models.
SVM:  

future work:
addressing the imbalnce data using one of the sampling techniques such as :
upsampling or downsampling  
apply other machine learning algo to address the given problem.
using differnt metric to evaluate our work like ROC, AUC, sapceficyty and senstiveity.
